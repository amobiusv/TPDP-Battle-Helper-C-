## What is TPDP-Battle-Helper
This is a tool that runs alongside the game **Touhou Puppet Dance Performance** and provides some extra information during battle that help people play the game without the use of a wiki. This tool updates itself dynamicaly by reading into memory, meaning that the user never needs to interact with it and can focus on just playing the game.
